The `ensorcelled-expressions-site` project is deployed through Vercel.

When setting up the project in Vercel:
	•	Project Directory: `ensorcelled-expressions-site`
	•	Build Command: `npm run build`
	•	Install Command: `npm install`
	•	Output Directory: `.next`

Vercel automatically handles workspace-based installs.

## Sanity CMS (Content Managent Interface)
